How to Check for a “Successful Chat” When Using Suggested Questions

You evaluate on three layers, in this exact order:

1. Behavioral Success Indicators (The Human Layer)

These measure whether the buyer’s behavior changed due to the suggested question.

A chat is successful when any of the following happen:

A. Buyer gives more detail than they volunteered before

Signal:
After you used a suggested question, the buyer expands on pains, blockers, or constraints.

Example:
Before: “We’re having some issues with onboarding.”
After using a suggested question: “Actually, the real problem is that our onboarding flow is inconsistent across teams…”

This is a strong signal that the question unlocked insight.

B. Buyer corrects themselves or rephrases

When they rethink their answer because of your question.

Example:
SDR: “Can you walk me through what ‘slow delivery’ means for you?”
Buyer: “Actually wait, I should be more precise…”

Correction = Engagement = Success.

C. Buyer acknowledges the question’s usefulness

Phrases to look for:

“Good question.”

“Let me think…”

“That’s interesting…”

“Nobody asked me that before.”

If you hear this → success.

D. Conversation moves from superficial → specific

This is measurable.

Before question:
“Yeah, things are a bit messy.”

After question:
“We have 3 engineers stuck on the customer side, 40% of sprint work gets interrupted by escalations, and we have no release planning.”

This is a tier-1 indicator.

2. Structural Success Indicators (The Sales Layer)

This measures whether the conversation progressed toward commitment.

A chat is successful if, after using a suggested question, the buyer moves one level up the commitment ladder:

The Commitment Ladder (5 Levels)

Information Sharing
“I’ll show you how the team works today.”

Resource Commitment
“I’ll bring the team lead to our next call.”

Time Commitment
“Let’s schedule a working session next week.”

Internal Alignment Commitment
“I’ll check internally and update you.”

Operational Commitment
“Send the proposal.” / “We want the pilot.”

If your suggested question leads to any upward movement, the chat is successful.

3. Outcome Success Indicators (The Business Layer)

This measures whether the call created deal progression assets.

A chat is successful if you leave with one or more of these:

A. A clear pain with quantified impact

Example:
“Escalations cost us 12–15 hours per week.”

B. Identified stakeholders

“We need Sarah (VP Eng) on the next call.”

C. A defined buying timeline

“We need a solution in Q1.”

D. A clear decision process

“Security needs to review before we purchase.”

E. A next step with a date

“Let’s meet Tuesday at 11.”

If you have two or more of these, the chat is a high-success call.

Put It All Together — The “Success Formula”

A suggested-question–driven chat is successful when these three boxes are checked:

Behavioral Shift (buyer opens up or gives more detail)

Structural Progression (buyer climbs the commitment ladder)

Outcome Asset (pain, timeline, stakeholder, next step)

If the chat achieved 2 out of 3, it was successful.
If it achieved 3 out of 3, it was excellent.

For Fast Evaluation: Use This 30-Second Checklist

After each chat, ask:

1. Did they give me more detail after the question?

Yes / No

2. Did they move up even one level in commitment?

Yes / No

3. Did I walk away with an actionable “asset”?

Pain

Stakeholder

Timeline

Decision process

Next step with date
(Any of these count.)

If 2 out of 3 = success.
If 3 out of 3 = strong success.
